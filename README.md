# Module 1 Resources

## Welcome to Module 1

- Here you will find all resources that are associated to your cohort during your time in Module 1!

## Clone this repo

- Cloning this repo is the first step to taking advantage of the
resources located here.
  - To review from your pre-course work you can run the following command
  to create a _local_ repository on your computer

    ```bash

    ```

## Updating this repo (DAILY)

- Git is an amazing tool that allows you to have the most up-to-date
  code your lecturer has written with a few simple steps

    1. Navigate to the Module-1-Resources repo

          ```bash
          cd ~/app_academy/Module-1-Resources
          ```

    2. Clear any changes you many have made locally

        ```bash
        git reset --hard
        ```

    3. Pull down any changes the lecture may have made while prepping

        ```bash
        git pull
        ```

    4. You can then DRAG/DROP the days folder into your own lecture folder

## Lectures

- Each lecture has notes and coding examples that you should follow along with. The lecture notes for the day will be called `README.md` and its associated code will be linked within the `README.md`. Just like this:

  - [Code it out](./example.js)

## Weekly Additional Resources

- Each week also has additional resources within that week's folder. Feel free to explore and find some helpful resources that may include things like cheat sheets and additional practice problems.
