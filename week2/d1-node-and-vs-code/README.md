`forEach`

- Hey there `forEach` Robo who's attached to an array.
- Here's a function.
- For each element that is in your array
- I'd like you to run this function giving it the element, index, and array.
- You don't have to give me anything back.

  ```js
  /* 
  Write a function called hello that intakes an 
  array of names and prints "Hello," plus the name, for
  each name. Must use .forEach()

  hello(['Mylo', 'Buster']) prints 'Hello, Mylo', 'Hello, Buster'
  */
  ```

`map`

- Hey there `map` Robo who's attached to an array.
- Here's a function.
- First, I'd like you to create a new array.
- Then, for each element that is in your array\
I'd like you to run this function giving it the element, index, and array,\
and push the return value of that function into the new array you created.
- Finally, you can give me the new array back.

  ```js
  /* 
  Write a function called timesTwo that intakes an
  array of numbers and returns a new array where all 
  of the numbers are multiplied by 2. You must use .map()

  timesTwo([1, 2, 3]) => [2, 4, 6]
  timesTwo([-1, 6, 0]) => [-2, 12, 0]
  */
  ```

`filter`

- Hey there `filter` Robo who's attached to an array.
- Here's a function.
- First, I'd like you to create a new array.
- Then, for each element that is in your array\
I'd like you to run this function giving it the element, index, and array.
  - If the `return` value of that function is true,\
  you should push it onto the new array you created.
- Finally, you can give me the new array back.

  ```js
  /* 
  Write a function called evens that intakes an
  array of numbers and returns a new array of only the
  even numbers from the original array. You must use
  .filter()

  evens([1, 2, 3]) => [2]
  evens([42, 44, 45]) => [42, 44]
  */
  ```

`reduce`

### No Default Accumulator

- Hey there `reduce` Robo who's attached to an array.
- Here's a function.
- First, assign the first element of your array as the accumulator.
- Then, starting at the second element of the array,\
I'd like you to run the function giving it the accumulator, element, index, and array,\
and make the `return` value of the function the new accumulator.
- Finally, you can give me the accumulator.

### Default Accumulator

- Hey there `reduce` Robo who's attached to an array.
- Here's a function. And what I'd like the accumulator to start with\
- First, assign what I gave you as the accumulator\
- Then, for each element that is in your array\
I'd like you to run the function giving it the accumulator, element, index, and array,\
and make the `return` value of the function the new accumulator.
`return` value of this function the new accumulator.
- Finally, you can give me the accumulator.

  ```js
  /* 
  Write a function called sum that intakes an
  array of names and returns a string of "Names: " with
  all of the names attached after. Must use the .reduce()

  reduce(['Mylo']) => Names: Mylo 
  reduce(['Rick', 'Morty']) => Names: Rick Morty 
  */
  ```
