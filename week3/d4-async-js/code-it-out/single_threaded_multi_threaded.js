// examples of multi threaded purposes 

// Web Browsers - A web browser can download any number of files and web pages (multiple tabs) at the same time and still lets you continue browsing. If a particular web page cannot be downloaded, that is not going to stop the web browser from downloading other web pages.
// Web Servers - A threaded web server handles each request with a new thread. There is a thread pool and every time a new request comes in, it is assigned to a thread from the thread pool.
// Computer Games - You have various objects like cars, humans, birds which are implemented as separate threads. Also playing the background music at the same time as playing the game is an example of multithreading.
// Text Editors - When you are typing in an editor, spell-checking, formatting of text and saving the text are done concurrently by multiple threads. The same applies for Word processors also.
// IDE - IDEs like Android Studio run multiple threads at the same time. You can open multiple programs at the same time. It also gives suggestions on the completion of a command which is a separate thread.
